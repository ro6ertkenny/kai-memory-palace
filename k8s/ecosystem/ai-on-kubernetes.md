# 🤖 AI on Kubernetes (Placeholder)

This document is a **deliberate placeholder** for future work at the intersection of:

- Kubernetes ☸️ (platform)
- AI / ML 🤖 (workloads)

## 🎯 Purpose
To ensure AI-on-Kubernetes topics are:
- Not forgotten
- Not prematurely siloed
- Introduced only when the ecosystem Wing is mature

## 🧠 Examples of Future Topics
- Running LLMs on Kubernetes
- GPU scheduling and device plugins
- Model serving (KServe, Triton, BentoML)
- Vector databases deployed via Helm
- AI pipelines orchestrated in-cluster
- Observability for AI workloads

## 🚧 Status
This file intentionally contains **no implementation details yet**.

Content will be added **only after**:
- Kubernetes foundations are solid
- Ops + provisioning workflows are repeatable
- Ecosystem tooling is well understood

## 🔁 Placement Rule
As long as Kubernetes is the platform and AI is the workload, this content belongs in:
