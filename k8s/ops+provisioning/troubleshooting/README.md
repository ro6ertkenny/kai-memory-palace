# 🛠️ Kubernetes Troubleshooting
*Failure analysis and recovery patterns*

---

## 📌 Purpose

This directory documents **Kubernetes troubleshooting practices**
within the `k8s/ops+provisioning` wing.

It focuses on:
- identifying failure domains
- distinguishing symptoms from root causes
- recovering safely without making problems worse

This is an **operator-first** view of troubleshooting.

---

## 🧠 Scope

Topics covered here will include:

- control-plane failures
- worker node failures
- networking and CNI issues
- certificate and authentication problems
- kubelet and container runtime issues
- common misconfigurations

Emphasis is placed on **reasoning and process**, not guesswork.

---

## 🧭 Reference Context

Real failure scenarios will reference the
**Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster**
as a concrete example where applicable.

---

## ▶️ Status

🚧 Placeholder

This directory will evolve into a collection of
diagnostic playbooks and recovery guides.
