# 🔁 Kubernetes Upgrades
*Version lifecycle and change management*

---

## 📌 Purpose

This directory documents **Kubernetes upgrade operations** within the
`k8s/ops+provisioning` wing.

Upgrades affect:
- cluster stability
- API compatibility
- node health
- operator trust in the system

This documentation focuses on **how operators plan, execute, and recover
from upgrades**, not on automation tooling.

---

## 🔁 Lifecycle Focus

Topics covered here include:

- Kubernetes version skew rules
- control-plane vs worker upgrade order
- kubeadm upgrade workflows
- OS and container runtime upgrades
- rollback considerations
- validation after upgrades

Upgrades are a core **Day-2 responsibility**.

---

## 🧭 Reference Context

Upgrade concepts will reference the
**Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster**
to illustrate real constraints and tradeoffs.

---

## ▶️ Status

🚧 Placeholder

This directory will be expanded with upgrade checklists,
decision criteria, and post-upgrade validation steps.
