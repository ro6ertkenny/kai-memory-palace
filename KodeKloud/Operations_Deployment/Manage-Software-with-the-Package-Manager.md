# Manage Software with the Package Manager

> This article explains how to manage software on Ubuntu using the apt package manager, covering installation, updates, upgrades, and removals.

This article explains how to install, update, upgrade, and remove software on Ubuntu using the apt package manager. Ubuntu simplifies software management by handling installation, upgrades, and dependency resolution with apt. Follow the examples below for practical guidance on managing your system's packages.

## Updating the Package Database

Before installing or upgrading any software, it is essential to refresh the local package database. Running the following command downloads the latest package information from the official repositories, ensuring that you work with up-to-date data.

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt update
```

Example output:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt update
[sudo] password for jeremy:
Get:1 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble InRelease [97.5 kB]
Get:2 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates InRelease [89.7 kB]
Get:3 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-backports InRelease [89.7 kB]
Get:4 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-security InRelease [89.7 kB]

```

  If the package information was last refreshed a while ago (for example, one week ago), running `sudo apt update` ensures you get the latest package listings.
</Callout>

## Upgrading Installed Packages

After updating the package database, you can upgrade the installed packages with:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt upgrade
```

When prompted, type "y" to confirm the upgrade. For added efficiency, you can chain the update and upgrade commands. Using the `&&` operator ensures that the upgrade command runs only if the update is successful:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Installing New Applications

To install a new application such as Nginx, run:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt install nginx
```

For a smoother process that uses the latest package data, chain the update and install commands together:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx
```

During the installation, additional dependencies, including necessary libraries and components, may be automatically installed to ensure Nginx runs correctly.

Example output when installing Nginx:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx
Hit:1 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble InRelease
Hit:2 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-security InRelease
Hit:3 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates InRelease
Hit:4 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-backports InRelease

The following additional packages will be installed:

The following NEW packages will be installed:
  nginx nginx-common

After this operation, 1,596 kB of additional disk space will be used.

```

## Understanding Packages

A package is an archive containing everything required by a piece of software, including binaries, configuration files, and documentation. Once a package is installed, you can inspect its contents with the dpkg tool.

For example, to list all files provided by the Nginx package:

```bash  theme={null}
dpkg --listfiles nginx
```

Example output:

```bash  theme={null}
.
usr
usr/sbin
usr/sbin/nginx
usr/share
usr/share/doc
usr/share/doc/nginx
usr/share/doc/nginx/changelog.Debian.gz
usr/share/doc/nginx/copyright
usr/share/man
usr/share/man/man8
usr/share/man/man8/nginx.8.gz
```

This output confirms that the Nginx executable is located at `/usr/sbin/nginx`.

To determine which package provides a specific file, use the `dpkg --search` command:

```bash  theme={null}
dpkg --search /usr/sbin/nginx
```

Example output:

```bash  theme={null}
jeremy@kodekloud:~$ dpkg --search /usr/sbin/nginx
nginx: /usr/sbin/nginx
jeremy@kodekloud:~$
```

To gather more details about a specific package, such as its dependencies or description, you can use the `apt show` command. For instance:

```bash  theme={null}
apt show libnginx-mod-stream
```

Example output:

```bash  theme={null}
jeremy@kodekloud:~$ apt show libnginx-mod-stream

jeremy@kodekloud:~$
```

## Searching for Packages

If you are unsure which package contains the software you need, you can search for it using `apt search`. For example, to find packages related to "nginx":

```bash  theme={null}
apt search nginx
```

This command looks through both package names and descriptions and may return multiple results. To narrow down the search to package names only, use the `--names-only` option:

```bash  theme={null}
apt search --names-only nginx
```

You can also search using multiple keywords. For example, to find a package that includes "nginx", "module", and "image", run:

```bash  theme={null}
apt search nginx-module-image
```

This ensures that all specified search terms are included in the results.

## Removing Packages

When a package is no longer necessary, you can remove it with the following command. For example, to remove Nginx:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt remove nginx
```

Example output:

```bash  theme={null}
jeremy@kodekloud:~$ sudo apt remove nginx
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  nginx nginx-common
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 2 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
After this operation, 1,596 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y
```

<Callout icon="lightbulb" color="#1CB2FE">
  This command removes only the main package. Residual dependencies that are no longer needed remain on the system.
</Callout>

To clean up those extra dependencies, use:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt autoremove nginx
```

Example output:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt autoremove nginx
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  nginx nginx-common
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 2 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
After this operation, 1,596 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y
(Reading database ... 83359 files and directories currently installed.)
Removing nginx-common (1.24.0-2ubuntu7) ...
Removing nginx (1.24.0-2ubuntu7) ...
Processing triggers for man-db (2.12.0-4build2) ...
```

If needed, you can always reinstall Nginx using:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo apt install nginx
```

Using `apt autoremove` is a convenient way to remove both the main package and any leftover dependencies in a single operation.
