# 🐧 Linux — Index

## 🎯 Purpose
This index is the **navigation and practice map** for the Linux wing.

It answers one question:

What should I practice next to operate Linux confidently and pass a Linux sysadmin exam?

This wing is operational.  
It is built for speed, accuracy, inspection, and safe recovery.

---

## 🧠 Mental Model
Linux operation is a loop:

Inspect → Explain → Act → Verify

If you cannot inspect and explain, you should not act.

---

## 🪜 Recommended Practice Order (Authoritative)

### 1) Foundations (always first)
Location:
linux/foundations/

Start here to establish reality:
- system-inspection.md

Outcome:
You can quickly determine whether a system is healthy, constrained, or failing.

---

### 2) Shell & Bash (control interface)
Location:
linux/shell-and-bash/

Use this to issue intent precisely:
- README.md
- index.md
- bash/ (subtree)

Outcome:
You can compose commands, pipelines, and inspections without guesswork.

---

### 3) Filesystems & Storage (paths and access)
Location:
linux/filesystems-and-storage/

Core file:
- filesystem-and-perms.md

Outcome:
Permission and path failures are explainable and fixable.

---

### 4) Processes & Resource Management (runtime behavior)
Location:
linux/process-and-resource-management/

Core file:
- processes-and-services.md

Outcome:
You can identify what is running, who controls it, and how to change state safely.

---

### 5) Networking (traffic flow diagnostics)
Location:
linux/networking/

Start with the domain anchor:
- README.md

Then practice the ladder:
- interface-and-addressing.md
- routes-and-reachability.md
- ports-and-listeners.md
- dns-and-name-resolution.md
- mistakes.md

Outcome:
Connectivity failures stop being mysterious.

---

### 6) Package Management (software state control)
Location:
linux/package-management/

Core file:
- package-management.md

Outcome:
You can inspect, install, remove, upgrade, and recover safely using apt-get.

---

### 7) Troubleshooting (recovery mindset)
Location:
linux/troubleshooting/

Use this when something breaks.
This is the “reduce panic” domain.

Outcome:
You recover quickly without blind changes.

---

## ⏱️ Daily Practice Template (20–30 minutes)
- 5 min → Foundations inspection (system-inspection)
- 10 min → One domain focus (rotate)
- 5–10 min → Applied task (edit a config, inspect a service, diagnose a failure)

Rules:
- no copy/paste dependence
- verify every command outcome
- change one variable at a time

---

## 🧭 Operating Rule
If unsure where to start, start here:

linux/foundations/system-inspection.md

Reality first.

---

## ✅ Outcome
Linux becomes predictable.

You can:
- inspect confidently
- diagnose methodically
- act deliberately
- verify results

That is Linux operational fluency.
