# 🐚 Bash
## Using the shell as an operational control interface

Mental mode: Controlling the system 

This directory treats **Bash as an interface**, not a programming language.
The focus is operational fluency: speed, accuracy, inspection, and recovery.

If you can reason clearly in Bash, you can reason clearly about Linux.

---

## Purpose
This subtree exists to help you:
- express intent clearly at the command line
- inspect real system state
- transform output into signal
- recover safely from mistakes

Bash is the connective tissue between thought and action.

---

## What This Is Not
This is not:
- a Bash scripting course
- a language reference
- a deep dive into POSIX standards

Those belong elsewhere.  
This directory exists for **daily operational control**.

---

## File Progression (Authoritative Order)

Read and practice in this order:

bash-basics.md  
bash-pipelines.md  
bash-expansion.md  
bash-history-and-job-control.md  
mistakes.md  

Each file builds leverage on the previous one.

---

## Core Principles

- Bash is a live interface to the system
- Commands are verbs, not incantations
- Output is data
- Pipes shape thought
- Errors are feedback

If a command surprises you, stop and investigate.

---

## Operational Expectations

By completing this subtree, you should be able to:
- navigate the filesystem without hesitation
- compose pipelines that inspect system state
- redirect output intentionally
- manage foreground and background jobs
- explain what a command will do before running it

---

## Discipline Rules

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Build commands incrementally
- Inspect output before acting on it
- Avoid blind copy/paste
- Type commands from memory whenever possible

Muscle memory matters.

---

## Relationship to Linux Wing

This subtree:
- supports system inspection
- accelerates troubleshooting
- enables Kubernetes workflows

It does not duplicate Linux concepts.
It provides **control surfaces** for them.

---

## Outcome

You should be able to say:

I can express intent through Bash,  
I understand the system’s response,  
and I can verify and act safely.

That is command-line fluency.
