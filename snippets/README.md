# 🧰 Snippets Wing

Welcome to the **Snippets Wing** of the Kai Memory Palace.

This wing is a **high-signal collection of reusable commands and patterns** used
frequently during Linux and Kubernetes operations. It exists to minimize friction
when you need an answer *now*.

Snippets are optimized for **speed of retrieval**, not explanation depth.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Snippets Wing exists to:

- Capture frequently used one-liners and short workflows
- Reduce repeated searching and re-learning
- Serve as a quick-reference during active work
- Support other wings by extracting their most-used commands

This wing is about **execution efficiency**.

---

## 🧠 Scope

Typical content in this wing includes:

- Linux one-liners (files, processes, permissions)
- Networking diagnostics (`ip`, `ss`, `ping`, `nmcli`)
- `kubectl` commands and patterns
- Common YAML patterns and flags
- Debugging shortcuts
- Safe cleanup commands
- Exam-friendly command patterns

Snippets should be **short, precise, and immediately usable**.

---

## 🧭 How This Wing Is Organized

Content is organized by **task or tool**, not by narrative.

Examples:

- `linux-one-liners.md`
- `kubectl-common.md`
- `networking-snippets.md`
- `filesystem-snippets.md`
- `debugging-shortcuts.md`
- `exam-time-savers.md`

Each file should:
- Group related commands
- Avoid long explanations
- Prefer comments over prose when needed
- Include warnings for destructive commands

---

## 🧰 Snippet Design Rules

All snippets follow these rules:

- One purpose per snippet
- Explicit flags (no magic)
- Copy-paste safe by default
- Destructive commands clearly labeled
- Minimal assumptions about environment

If a command requires context, link to the appropriate wing.

---

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- Destructive commands must be clearly marked
- Prefer read-only commands unless mutation is intended
- Never include secrets or credentials
- Assume snippets may be copied under pressure

Safety and clarity are non-negotiable.

## 🧠 Relationship to Other Wings

| Wing            | Relationship to Snippets |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 🐧 Linux         | Source of system commands |
| ☸️ Kubernetes    | Source of kubectl patterns |
| 🌐 Networking   | Source of diagnostics |
| ✍️ Vim           | Used to edit and refine snippets |
| 🤙 Kai          | Mental discipline around usage |

Snippets are **extracted practice**, not standalone learning.

---

## 📌 Intended Audience

- Operators in active troubleshooting mode
- Learners building muscle memory
- Exam candidates under time pressure
- Engineers optimizing daily workflows

The tone is **direct, concise, and instructional**.

---

## 🏁 Status

🚧 Active and evolving

This wing grows as patterns stabilize and repetition reveals what matters.
