# 🤙 Kai Wing

Welcome to the **Kai Wing** of the Kai Memory Palace.

This wing documents **how to think, decide, and operate** while working with Linux,
Kubernetes, and infrastructure systems. It intentionally sits above tools and
commands to capture judgment, process, and durable mental models.

If other wings answer *what* and *how*, this wing answers *why*.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Kai Wing exists to:

- Capture mental models used to reason about systems
- Document decision-making frameworks and tradeoffs
- Preserve operational checklists and heuristics
- Record troubleshooting approaches that generalize
- Define learning discipline and professional habits

This content is **tool-agnostic** and **long-lived**.

---

## 🧠 What Belongs Here

Artifacts in this wing typically include:

- **Mental models**
  - How to decompose complex systems
  - How to reason about failures and recovery
- **Checklists**
  - Pre-flight checks
  - Post-incident reviews
  - “Before you touch production” rules
- **Principles**
  - Manual understanding before automation
  - Observe state before acting
  - Documentation as part of operations
- **Troubleshooting discipline**
  - Structured diagnosis over guesswork
  - Layer-by-layer isolation
- **Learning practice**
  - Learning in public
  - Building durable knowledge
  - Reducing cognitive load

This wing is intentionally **small, curated, and high signal**.

## 🧭 How This Wing Is Organized

Content is organized as **conceptual artifacts**, not tutorials.

Examples:

- `mental-models.md`
- `principles.md`
- `checklists.md`
- `troubleshooting-playbook.md`
- `learning-in-public.md`

Each artifact should:
- Stand on its own
- Apply across tools and environments
- Be concise and deliberate
- Emphasize judgment over mechanics

---

## 🧰 Operating Philosophy

Guidance in this wing follows these principles:

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Make state visible before changing it
- Slow down to go faster
- Document decisions while context exists
- Optimize for future recall

This wing exists to **improve outcomes under pressure**.

## 🧠 Relationship to Other Wings

| Wing            | Relationship to Kai |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| 🐧 Linux         | System behavior informs judgment |
| ☸️ Kubernetes    | Distributed systems demand discipline |
| 🌐 Networking   | Diagnosis relies on mental models |
| ✍️ Vim           | Focus and intent during editing |
| 🧰 Snippets     | Execution guided by judgment |

The Kai Wing provides the **conceptual glue** between all technical domains.

---

## 📌 Intended Audience

- The future version of yourself
- Engineers evaluating operational maturity
- Recruiters assessing judgment and discipline
- Learners interested in *how* experts think

The tone is **clear, neutral, and instructional**.

---

## 🏁 Status

🚧 Active and evolving

This wing evolves slowly as principles are refined through experience.
