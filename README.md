# 🏛️ Kai Memory Palace

A **Linux-first, Kubernetes-focused knowledge base** documenting my transition
from founder and product builder to Linux system administrator and Kubernetes
operator — built **in public**, with intent, structure, and durability.

This repository serves as a **memory palace**: a spatial, organized system for
capturing commands, concepts, mental models, and operational practice so they can
be retrieved quickly and reliably over time.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Kai Memory Palace exists to:

- Build durable Linux and Kubernetes knowledge
- Document real, hands-on learning and operations
- Reduce cognitive load by externalizing memory
- Serve as a public learning archive and reference
- Provide clear signal to recruiters and engineers

This is not a collection of random notes.
It is a **deliberately structured system**.

## 🌱 Learning in Public  
*(Documenting real work and real understanding as it develops, so both progress
and mistakes are visible, reviewable, and reusable.)*

Learning in public means:
- Writing while learning, not after mastery
- Leaving a visible trail of decisions and corrections
- Treating documentation as part of the work
- Optimizing for clarity over polish

## 🗺️ The Palace Structure

The repository is organized into **wings**, each representing a domain of practice:

| Wing | Focus |
|-----|------|
| 🐧 **Linux** | System administration, services, filesystems, users |
| ☸️ **Kubernetes** | Cluster operations, workloads, YAML, troubleshooting |
| ✍️ **Vim** | Editing mechanics and muscle memory |
| 🌐 **Networking** | IP addressing, DNS, routing, connectivity |
| 🧰 **Snippets** | Reusable commands and patterns |
| 🤙 **Kai** | Mental models, checklists, principles, and judgment |

Each wing contains focused documentation and grows independently.

## 🧠 Why a “Memory Palace”

A memory palace works by:
- Assigning knowledge to locations
- Creating consistent structure
- Making recall faster than re-learning

This repository applies the same principle to:
- Linux commands
- Kubernetes workflows
- Operational thinking
- Troubleshooting patterns

The goal is **retrieval**, not accumulation.
