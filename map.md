2. Use this map to choose a wing
3. Navigate within a wing via its `README.md`
4. Add new artifacts where they *belong*
5. Refine structure as understanding grows

> Knowledge should be easier to **retrieve** than to **recreate**.

If you have to search, re-learn, or guess — the palace needs refinement.
