# 🧭 Vim Wing — Index

## 🎯 Purpose
This index is the navigation and practice map for the Vim wing.

It answers one question only:

What should I practice right now?

---

## 🧠 Mental Mode
Editing without thinking.

This index exists to keep practice deliberate, scoped, and repeatable.

---

## 🪜 Recommended Practice Order

### 1. Fundamentals (daily)
Start here. Always.

Location:
vim/fundamentals/

Files:
- movement.md
- editing.md
- search-and-replace.md
- buffers-windows-tabs.md

These build core reflexes.  
If something feels slow, return here.

---

### 2. Workflows (situational)
Apply fundamentals to real problems.

Location:
vim/workflows/

Files:
- vim-for-configs.md
- vim-for-logs.md

These reinforce why Vim matters in Linux and Kubernetes work.

---

### 3. Troubleshooting (as needed)
Use only when something breaks.

Location:
vim/troubleshooting/

File:
- mistakes.md

This is a recovery guide, not a study guide.

---

### 4. Exam and Survival (last)
Only after fundamentals feel automatic.

Location:
vim/exam-and-survival/

File:
- exam-survival-tips.md

This file introduces no new skills.  
It stabilizes behavior under pressure.

---

## ⏱️ Daily Practice Template
- 5 min fundamentals
- 10 min one focused topic
- 5 min real file (YAML, README, config)

No mouse.  
No arrows.  
No jumping ahead.

---

## 🧭 Operating Rule
If unsure what to practice, start with:

vim/fundamentals/movement.md

Navigation precedes everything.

---

## ✅ Outcome
Vim becomes invisible.

You stop navigating files.  
You start operating systems.
