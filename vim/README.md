# 🪽 Vim Wing — README

## 🎯 Purpose
This wing exists to make Vim invisible.

Vim is not learned here.  
Vim is conditioned.

The goal is to edit files without conscious thought.

---

## 🧠 Mental Mode
Editing without thinking.

Hands move automatically.  
Eyes track structure.  
Mind stays on intent.

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Wing
Start with:

vim/index.md

That file defines:
- practice order
- when to revisit fundamentals
- how this wing is used day to day

This README defines why the wing exists.  
The index defines how to move through it.

## 🧩 Why Vim Comes First
Every Linux and Kubernetes task touches text.

If Vim is frictionless, everything else accelerates.

Mental model:
- Vim → the hands
- Bash → the interface
- Linux → the system

Slow hands slow the system.

---

## 🧪 Operating Rule
If an action requires thought, it belongs in a drill.

If it is automatic, it belongs in muscle memory.

---

## ✅ Outcome
Vim fades into the background.

Your hands move.  
Your mind stays on the system.
