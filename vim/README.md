# ✍️ Vim Wing

Welcome to the **Vim Wing** of the Kai Memory Palace.

This wing exists to build **editing speed, precision, and confidence** using Vim
as a primary tool for Linux system administration and Kubernetes operations.

Vim is treated here not as an editor to “get through,” but as a **force multiplier**
for thinking and working inside text-based systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Vim Wing exists to:

- Develop muscle memory for efficient text editing
- Reduce friction when working with configs, YAML, and logs
- Prepare for real-world ops work and certification environments
- Shift editing from conscious effort to instinctive action

Vim proficiency is not optional for serious Linux and Kubernetes work.

---

## 🧠 Scope

Topics in this wing include, but are not limited to:

- Modal editing fundamentals
- Movement and navigation
- Editing, deleting, and changing text
- Visual mode and selections
- Searching and substitution
- Working with multiple files and buffers
- Editing YAML safely and efficiently
- Vim configuration basics
- Exam-oriented workflows (CKA-style environments)

---

## 🧭 How This Wing Is Organized

Content in this wing is organized as **small, repeatable practice artifacts**.

Examples:

- `modes-and-movement.md`
- `editing-basics.md`
- `search-and-replace.md`
- `visual-mode.md`
- `vim-for-yaml.md`
- `common-mistakes.md`
- `exam-survival-tips.md`

Each artifact should:
- Focus on one skill or concept
- Include short, repeatable exercises
- Emphasize muscle memory over theory
- Be usable without plugins or IDE features

---

## 🧰 Practice Philosophy

Learning Vim here follows these principles:

- Practice daily, briefly, and deliberately
- Prefer repetition over memorization
- Learn commands in context, not in isolation
- Accept temporary slowdown as part of mastery
- Use Vim for real work as early as possible

Games, tutorials, and drills are used **to build instinct**, not replace real usage.

## 🧠 Relationship to Other Wings

| Wing            | Relationship to Vim |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| 🐧 Linux         | Vim is the primary editor for Linux systems |
| ☸️ Kubernetes    | YAML and manifests are edited in Vim |
| 🌐 Networking   | Config files and diagnostics are edited in Vim |
| 🧰 Snippets     | Snippets are authored and refined in Vim |
| 🤙 Kai          | Mental discipline and focus during editing |

Vim is the interface between thought and system state.

---

## 📌 Intended Audience

- Linux learners committing to Vim
- Kubernetes practitioners preparing for CKA
- Engineers seeking editing fluency under pressure
- Anyone replacing mouse-driven workflows with intent

The tone is **clear, neutral, and instructional**.

---

## 🏁 Status

🚧 Active and evolving

This wing grows as editing speed increases and friction decreases.
