# 🪽 Vim Wing — README

## 🎯 Purpose
This wing exists to make **Vim invisible**.

Vim is not learned here — it is **conditioned**.  
The goal is to edit files **without conscious thought**, so attention stays on Linux and Kubernetes problems, not on the editor.

---

## 🧠 Mental Mode
**Editing without thinking**

- hands move automatically  
- eyes track structure  
- mind stays on intent  

Vim becomes an extension of the keyboard, not a subject of study.

---

## 🧩 Why Vim Comes First
Every Linux / Kubernetes task touches text:

- configuration files
- YAML manifests
- logs
- scripts
- documentation

If Vim is frictionless, **everything else accelerates**.

Mental model:
- **Vim** → the hands  
- **Linux / Bash** → the environment  
- **Kubernetes** → the system  

Slow hands slow the system.

---

## 🧭 Scope
This wing focuses only on **core, durable Vim skills** that compound daily.

Included:
- movement
- editing primitives
- search and replace
- visual mode
- buffers and splits
- working safely with configs and logs
- operating under time pressure

Excluded:
- history or philosophy
- plugin ecosystems
- theming
- novelty commands
- editor debates

If it does not improve daily speed and safety, it does not belong here.

---

## 🧭 How This Wing Is Organized
Content in this wing is organized as **small, repeatable practice artifacts**.

Each file is:
- narrow in scope
- drillable in isolation
- durable over time

No file attempts to teach Vim end-to-end.

---

## ⚙️ How This Wing Is Used
This wing is **not** read sequentially.

It is used as:
- a drill reference
- a muscle-memory checklist
- a corrective tool when friction appears
- a pre-exam confidence stabilizer

Repetition > coverage.

---

## ⏱️ Practice Discipline
Daily practice is short and deliberate.

- ~20 minutes per session
- one focus topic at a time
- no jumping ahead
- no mouse
- no arrow keys

Speed comes from **constraint**, not exploration.

## 📁 File Index (LOCKED)

### `movement.md`
Navigation fundamentals:
- words, lines, paragraphs, screens
- reaching text without thinking

---

### `editing.md`
Core editing mechanics:
- insert vs normal
- delete, change, yank, paste
- visual mode (line and block)
- indentation

---

### `search-and-replace.md`
Targeting text precisely:
- forward/backward search
- repetition
- substitution (line vs file)
- safe confirmation

---

### `buffers-windows-tabs.md`
Situational awareness:
- buffers vs files
- splits for comparison
- moving efficiently between views
- avoiding unnecessary tabs

---

### `vim-for-configs.md`
Structured text safety:
- YAML discipline
- indentation integrity
- multi-line edits
- avoiding invisible breakage

---

### `vim-for-logs.md`
Read-only efficiency:
- scanning large files
- jumping between patterns
- extracting signal from noise

---

### `mistakes.md`
Only recurring failures:
- mode confusion
- accidental deletes
- recovery techniques

This file stays short by design.

---

### `exam-survival-tips.md`
Time-pressure operation:
- fastest safe workflows
- recovery under stress
- bare-bones Vim tactics
- checklist mentality

This file introduces **no new skills**.

---

## 🧪 Operating Rule
If an action requires thought, it belongs in a drill.

If it becomes automatic, it graduates into muscle memory.

---

## ✅ Outcome
Vim fades into the background.

Your hands move.  
Your mind stays on the system.
