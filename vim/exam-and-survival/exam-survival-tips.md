# 🧪 exam-survival-tips.md — Operating Vim Under Time Pressure

## 🎯 Purpose
Use Vim effectively when the clock is running.

This file exists to:
- reduce mistakes under stress
- preserve speed without panic
- reinforce safe, known workflows

No new skills are introduced here.

---

## 🧠 Mental Rule
Operate. Do not explore.

If you try something “clever” during an exam, you are already behind.

---

## ⏱️ Time Management Habits
- move with intent
- search before editing
- avoid unnecessary perfection
- leave the file as soon as the task is complete

Done is better than elegant.

---

## 🔍 Search Is Your Primary Tool
Always locate targets using search.

- use specific tokens
- jump between matches
- confirm context before editing

Never scroll looking for something.

---

## ✂️ Prefer Change Over Delete
When modifying text:
- use change commands
- type once
- exit Insert mode immediately

This limits error surface.

---

## 🪟 Use Splits Sparingly
Splits are for:
- comparing YAML
- referencing instructions
- confirming values

If a split causes confusion, close it.

---

## 🛑 Avoid These Under Pressure
- global replace without confirmation
- editing indentation in Insert mode
- opening many tabs
- experimenting with commands you don’t use daily

Exams reward discipline, not creativity.

---

## 🧯 Recovery Is Part of Speed
If something feels wrong:
- stop
- Esc
- undo
- reorient
- continue

Fast recovery beats flawless execution.

---

## 🧪 Final Pre-Exam Check
Before starting:
- confirm Vim basics feel automatic
- review mistakes.md
- trust muscle memory

You do not need more commands.  
You need control.

---

## ✅ Exit Criteria
You are done with this file when:
- stress no longer changes behavior
- workflows stay simple
- Vim remains invisible under pressure

You now operate calmly.
