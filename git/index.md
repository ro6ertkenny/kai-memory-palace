# 🧭 Git Wing — Index
*How to navigate this wing*

---

## 📌 Purpose

This index provides a **navigation map** for the `git` wing of
`kai-memory-palace`.

It explains:
- how Git knowledge is organized here
- what problems each section solves
- where to look under pressure

This is a **working reference**, not a tutorial.

---

## 🧠 Mental Model

Think of Git as three distinct states:

Working tree → Staging area → Commit history

Most mistakes come from confusing these states.

This wing is organized to reinforce:
- clarity between states
- intentional transitions
- safe rollback paths

---

## 🗂️ Wing Structure

This wing will evolve to include:

### 📁 Workflows
Reusable, step-by-step patterns for real tasks, such as:
- creating a new wing
- scaffolding directories
- refactoring repositories
- thinning repos safely
- coordinating changes across repos

### 📁 Commits
Guidance on:
- staging strategy
- grouping related changes
- writing meaningful commit messages
- reviewing history for clarity

### 📁 Recovery
Techniques for:
- undoing staging mistakes
- fixing bad commits
- recovering from failed refactors
- understanding reset vs revert

---

## 🔁 How This Wing Is Used

Other wings may reference this wing when they need to:

- explain how changes were committed
- point to a standard workflow
- link to recovery guidance
- avoid repeating Git explanations

This wing acts as the **single source of truth for Git usage**.

## ▶️ Where to Start

Recommended path:

1. Understand the mental model (this file)
2. Learn core workflows
3. Practice recovery techniques
4. Apply consistently across projects

Good Git usage is invisible when things go well—and invaluable when they don’t.
