# 🧭 Git Wing — Master Index

This index is the **authoritative navigation map** for the Git wing of
**kai-memory-palace**.

It defines the **mental primitives**, rules, and workflows for using Git safely,
deliberately, and professionally across all domains (Kubernetes, Linux, general development).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Git wing answers:

- How changes are made safely
- How history is preserved intentionally
- How forks are maintained
- How updates are integrated without guesswork

This wing prioritizes **judgment and discipline** over memorization of commands.

---

## 🧱 Core Canons

### 1️⃣ Change Discipline
- `change-workflow.md`  
  Edit → diff → stage → commit discipline

- `review-checklist.md`  
  What “done” means before pushing

---

### 2️⃣ Fork & Update Discipline
- `forks-and-upstream.md`  
  Canonical handling of `origin` vs `upstream` for forked repositories

- `update-decision-tree.md`  
  Fetch → inspect → integrate judgment  
  (merge vs rebase vs do nothing)

---

## 🧠 Mental Model

- Fetching is always safe
- Inspection precedes action
- Integration is intentional
- History is never rewritten casually

This wing encodes **how professionals think with Git**, not just what they type.

---

## 🚦 Scope Rules

- This wing owns **Git fundamentals and discipline**
- Other wings may reference it
- Git rules live here, not scattered elsewhere

If a question is about *how to safely change history*, it belongs here.

---

## 🗺️ Navigation Rule

If you are unsure:
1. Start here
2. Follow the canon
3. Act deliberately
