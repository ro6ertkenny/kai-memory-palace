# 🧠 Git & Version Control
*Intentional workflows, clean history, safe recovery*

---

## 📌 Purpose

This wing documents **Git and version-control practices** used throughout
`kai-memory-palace`.

Git is treated as a **first-class engineering discipline**, not a collection
of memorized commands.

This wing exists to capture:

- how to think about changes
- how to group work intentionally
- how to build readable commit history
- how to recover safely from mistakes
- how to work confidently under pressure

The focus is on **judgment and workflow**, not tooling trivia.

---

## 🧭 Scope

This wing covers:

- core Git mental models
- staging and commit strategy
- repository refactors and restructuring
- multi-repo coordination
- safe undo and recovery techniques
- reusable workflows for real projects

It does **not** cover:
- hosting platform features
- CI/CD pipelines
- advanced branching strategies (yet)

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

A few guiding principles shape everything in this wing:

- **Commits are communication**  
  They should explain *why* something changed, not just *what*.

- **History should tell a story**  
  A clean commit log is a form of documentation.

- **Small, intentional changes beat large, vague ones**  
  Precision reduces risk.

- **Mistakes are expected**  
  Recovery skills matter more than perfection.

## 🔁 Relationship to Other Wings

Git workflows documented here are used by:

- Kubernetes wings (cluster and ops documentation)
- Linux system work
- refactors and structural changes
- long-lived documentation systems

Other wings may reference this wing for **how to execute changes**, but
this wing owns the **how and why of version control**.

## ▶️ Where to Start

If you are new to this wing:

1. Read the mental models in `index.md`
2. Learn the standard workflows used in this repository
3. Practice recovery techniques intentionally
4. Apply these patterns consistently across wings

This wing exists to make every other wing safer and clearer.
