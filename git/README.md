# 🧬 Git Wing

This directory defines the **authoritative Git discipline** used throughout
**kai-memory-palace**.

It encodes:
- how changes are made
- how forks are maintained
- how updates are integrated safely
- how history is preserved intentionally

---

## 🧠 What Lives Here

This wing focuses on **judgment**, not just commands.

Included topics:
- Change workflows and review discipline
- Fork hygiene (`origin` vs `upstream`)
- Safe update strategies (merge vs rebase)
- Explicit decision-making before modifying history

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Wing

- Start with `index.md` for navigation
- Treat each document as a **canon**
- Follow rules exactly; do not improvise under pressure

This wing exists to eliminate:
- panic merges
- accidental history rewrites
- unclear Git states
- guesswork during updates

---

## 🚦 Scope Boundary

This wing owns **Git thinking and discipline**.

It does not contain:
- project-specific workflows
- CI/CD configuration
- tooling beyond Git itself

Other wings may reference Git rules, but **this wing defines them**.
