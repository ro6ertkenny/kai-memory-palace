# 🧱 Templates Wing

Welcome to the **Templates Wing** of the Kai Memory Palace.

This wing contains **reusable Markdown templates** used to capture knowledge in a
consistent, predictable format across the entire repository.

Templates reduce cognitive load and ensure that notes remain easy to scan,
navigate, and retrieve over time.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Templates Wing exists to:

- Enforce consistent structure across artifacts
- Reduce friction when writing new notes
- Improve readability and scan-ability
- Encourage high-signal documentation
- Make “learning in public” sustainable

This wing supports **how knowledge is captured**, not the knowledge itself.

---

## 🧠 What Belongs Here

Artifacts in this wing are **not notes**, but **formats**.

Typical templates include:

- Concept explanation templates
- Command reference templates
- Troubleshooting templates
- Incident / post-mortem templates
- Learning notes templates
- Certification study templates

Templates should be:
- Generic
- Reusable
- Tool-agnostic
- Lightweight

---

## 🧭 Example Templates

Examples of files that may live here:

- `concept.md`
- `command-reference.md`
- `troubleshooting.md`
- `learning-notes.md`
- `exam-prep.md`

Each template provides:
- A clear title structure
- Standard sections
- Guidance comments (to be removed when used)

---

## 🧰 Template Philosophy

All templates follow these principles:

- Structure over prose
- Consistency over creativity
- Explicit headings
- Minimal filler
- Easy copy-and-paste usage

If writing feels harder than thinking, the template needs improvement.
