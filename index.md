# 🧠 Kai Memory Palace
## A structured learning system and knowledge base (memory palace) for Linux and Kubernetes

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is a **learning-first knowledge system** designed for people who:

- are new (or rusty) with Linux and Kubernetes
- want understanding, not memorization
- want skills that compound instead of fragment

It answers one core question:

> “In what order should I learn things so Linux and Kubernetes actually make sense?”

This is not a tutorial dump.
It is a **progression-based learning palace**.

## 🚦 If You’re New — Start Here

If you are **new to Linux, Kubernetes, or platform engineering**, do **not**
start with Kubernetes.

Start with **control**, then **fluency**, then **systems**, then **orchestration**.

### ✅ Recommended Learning Path (In Order)

### 1️⃣ Vim
**Mental mode:** Control your editor

Before anything else, you must be able to:
- open files confidently
- edit without friction
- move, search, and modify text efficiently

If your editor fights you, everything else becomes painful.

👉 Start here: `vim/`

---

### 2️⃣ Bash & Shell
**Mental mode:** Control the command line

Before Linux “concepts,” you must be able to:
- navigate the filesystem
- run commands intentionally
- chain commands together
- understand stdout, stderr, and exit codes

This is how you *talk* to Linux.

👉 Start here: `linux/shell-and-bash/`

---

### 3️⃣ Linux
**Mental mode:** Understand the operating system

Now you learn what’s actually happening underneath:

- processes
- filesystems
- networking
- memory and CPU
- permissions and security

Linux is the **substrate** everything else runs on.

👉 Start here: `linux/index.md`

---

### 4️⃣ Kubernetes
**Mental mode:** Orchestrate Linux systems

Only after Linux makes sense does Kubernetes stop feeling magical.

Kubernetes is:
- Linux at scale
- processes scheduled declaratively
- networking abstracted
- failure handled continuously

👉 Start here: `k8s/index.md`

---

Skipping steps creates fragile understanding.
Following this path creates confidence.

## 🧭 How This Repository Is Organized

Knowledge is organized into **wings**, each with a clear purpose:

- Vim → editing fluency
- Bash → command-line fluency
- Linux → system understanding
- Kubernetes → orchestration and operations
- Ecosystem → optional extensions

Each wing has:
- a README for scope
- an index for navigation
- focused concept documents

---

## 🐧 Linux
*The upstream foundation*

Linux explains:
- why processes behave the way they do
- why containers feel “weird”
- why Kubernetes acts the way it does

👉 Entry point: `linux/index.md`

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes
*The orchestration layer*

Kubernetes builds on Linux to provide:
- declarative reconciliation
- scheduling and placement
- networking abstractions
- extensibility

Kubernetes only feels complex when Linux is unclear.

👉 Entry point: `k8s/index.md`

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

All content in this repository follows these rules:

- Concept before command
- Understanding before automation
- Boundaries before tools
- Visibility before control
- Progression before complexity

These principles protect long-term learning.

---

## 🎯 Intended Outcome

After following this repository in order, you should be able to say:

I can edit efficiently,  
I can use the shell confidently,  
I understand Linux as a system,  
and Kubernetes now makes sense.

That is durable platform understanding.
